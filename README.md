# Loki Systems Service Tracker 🖥️📊

A lightweight service tracking application built for **Loki Systems**, a cyber cafe based in Kenya. This app was created for a close personal friend looking to track day-to-day service records and gradually build a dataset for data-driven decision-making.

## 📌 Purpose

This app helps Loki Systems:
- Log services provided, including time, date, and fee.
- View, manage, and delete past records.
- Generate monthly earnings reports and identify popular services.
- Archive past months and start fresh each month.

The goal is to eventually **leverage this collected data for business analysis**, identify trends, and optimize service offerings.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Simple and clean GUI (Tkinter)
- ✅ Record new service entries
- ✅ View past services in a sortable table
- ✅ Delete incorrect entries
- ✅ Monthly earnings summary and service stats
- ✅ Export monthly data to `.csv` and clear logs
- ✅ Resizable UI with Kenyan-themed colors

## 🧐 Future Ideas

- Integrate data visualization (bar charts, trends)

- Basic analytics (e.g., revenue growth, retention)

- AI assistant to recommend service strategies

- Cloud sync or multi-user support

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Tkinter
- SQLite
- Pillow (for optional logo support)

## 💬 Author Note

This project was built with passion and friendship in mind — Loki Systems is more than a client. It's a chance to help a small business grow smarter with data.
